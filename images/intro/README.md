## 1. `overviewCPU.png`

**Topic**: CPU Architecture & Operation
This diagram explains the main internal and external components of a CPU:

* **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: performs arithmetic and logical operations
* **Control Unit**: directs the operations of the processor
* **Cache Memory**: fast-access memory for CPU operations
* **Main Memory**: general RAM used for running programs
* **Input/Output Devices**: connected peripherals
* **Backing Storage**: long-term data storage

Keywords: ALU, cache, control unit, main memory, CPU components

## 2. `cooling-system.png`

**Topic**: Data Center Cooling & Power Redundancy
This diagram shows a complete **IT infrastructure cooling and backup system**, including:

* **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** and **Diesel Generators**
* Dual lines for **cooling system redundancy** (green/red lines)
* Main cooling unit connected to power transfer and control stations

Keywords: cooling, UPS, redundancy, diesel engine, IT equipment

## 3. `bruteforce-bwa-blastn.png`

**Topic**: Algorithm Efficiency Comparison
Comparison of time (in seconds) required by different approaches to read 1 and 1000 lines of data:

* **Brute Force**: Extremely inefficient (409s / 410000s)
* **BLASTn**: Optimized search (\~0.54s / 574.1s)
* **BWA**: Best performance (\~3.2s / 3.6s)

Highlights the advantage of using **specialized bioinformatics tools** for scalability.

Keywords: brute force, BLAST, BWA, performance, bioinformatics

## 4. `BIGDATA.png`

**Topic**: The 4 V's of Big Data
Illustrates the core properties of big data:

* **Volume**: huge amounts of data
* **Variety**: different formats (structured/unstructured)
* **Velocity**: speed of generation and processing
* **Veracity**: reliability and truthfulness

Keywords: big data, 4Vs, unstructured, variety, velocity, veracity

## 5. `5Vs.png`

**Topic**: Big Data Characteristics – Extended
Expands the previous concept by adding the 5th V:

* **Value**: ability to extract useful insights from data
  Includes how big data impacts real life: sensors, logs, real-time decisions.

Keywords: value, 5Vs, data streams, data processing, insight extraction
