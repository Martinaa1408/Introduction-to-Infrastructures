# Computing
This folder contains visual explanations of computing job types and resource allocation strategies used in High Throughput Computing (HTC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) environments.

`job-types.png`
This diagram illustrates various types of jobs submitted to computing infrastructures:

Single batch job: An isolated task with no dependencies.

DAG workflow: A Directed Acyclic Graph structure where tasks are executed based on logical dependencies.

Collection: A group of independent jobs submitted together.

Parametric: A set of jobs generated by varying parameters over a template.

Parallel: Jobs that must run simultaneously across multiple cores or machines.

Connection: This image links to the concept of workflow structures in `HTC-HPC-workflow.png` (from the Job scheduling section), as it outlines how job logic is organized.

`resources.png`
This image shows a resource sharing policy over time between two user groups (A and B):

Both groups are initially allocated 50% of the computing resources.

Group A temporarily stops, and Group B uses excess capacity.

When Group A returns, it reclaims its share.

Compensation mechanisms ensure fairness over time.

Connection: This image connects with `queue.png` (from the Job scheduling section) and represents the practical implementation of fair-sharing policies and backfilling used by job queues in batch systems.
