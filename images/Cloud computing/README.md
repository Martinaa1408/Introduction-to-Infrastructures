# Cloud computing
This folder contains key diagrams and visual materials that illustrate the core principles of cloud computing, its service models, economic implications, and lifecycle of technology adoption. These resources support understanding of how cloud infrastructure and platforms work, and how they are adopted over time.

## Image Descriptions

`Cloud-computing.png`
Description: This image visually presents the three core layers of cloud computing:

Infrastructure (Compute, Storage, Network)

Platform (Runtime, Identity, Queue)

Application (Collaboration, Monitoring, Finance)

It also shows end-user devices such as laptops, desktops, tablets, and phones, all interacting with cloud services.

Concept: Demonstrates how cloud services are modular and accessed over the internet. It supports understanding of the IaaS, PaaS, SaaS stack.

`IaaS-PaaS-SaaS.png`
Description: This diagram compares the three primary cloud service models:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): User manages most layers except hardware and virtualization.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): Vendor handles infrastructure and runtime, user focuses on apps and data.

Software as a Service (SaaS): Vendor manages everything; user just consumes the application.

Concept: Essential to distinguish what is managed by the provider vs the user. Helps choose the appropriate level of abstraction for different use cases.

`Legacy-CloudAware.png`
Description: This visual contrasts Legacy Tenants with Cloud-Aware Tenants, showing:

Legacy systems often rely on static provisioning.

Cloud-aware systems integrate HA/DR (High Availability/Disaster Recovery) policies at both the application and infrastructure level.

Concept: Highlights the shift from traditional IT towards cloud-native strategies, emphasizing resilience and automation.

`cloud-economics.png`
Description: A side-by-side comparison of:

Static provisioning (wasteful resource allocation).

Elastic cloud provisioning (dynamic scaling aligned with demand).

Concept: Key for understanding cost optimization and resource utilization in cloud environments. Underlines how cloud avoids over-provisioning while meeting SLAs.

`plateu.png`
Description: Depicts the Gartner Hype Cycle:

Technology Trigger → Peak of Inflated Expectations → Trough of Disillusionment → Slope of Enlightenment → Plateau of Productivity.

Shows also search trend data highlighting public attention vs actual value.

Concept: Helps situate cloud computing and other technologies in their adoption lifecycle, critical for making strategic decisions about technology investments.

## Conceptual Links:

`Cloud-computing.png` serves as the foundation: it connects all other diagrams by illustrating the interaction of infrastructure, platform, and application layers.

`IaaS-PaaS-SaaS.png` expands on this by explaining which roles users and vendors play at each level.

`Legacy-CloudAware.png` shows how modern users (tenants) better leverage the stack defined in the previous diagrams.

`cloud-economics.png` justifies the need for such architectures from a cost-efficiency standpoint.

`plateu.png` provides a realistic view of how cloud technologies evolve, are perceived, and are ultimately adopted or discarded.
