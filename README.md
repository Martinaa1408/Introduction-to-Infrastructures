## BDP1_2025 - Introduction to Big Data Processing Infrastructures

**Welcome to the official repository of the BDP1 2025 course!**  
This repository contains educational resources, lecture summaries, quizzes, and exam preparation material for the *Introduction to Big Data Processing Infrastructures* course, part of the MSc in Bioinformatics.

## Abstract and Information

The course will provide basic concepts of Computing Infrastructures for processing Big Data and for running scientific applications. In particular it will focus on the Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud paradigm. 
The course will provide an introduction to Big Data and how they are related to scientific  applications. 
It will continue with a description of the building blocks of modern Data Centers and how they are abstracted by the Cloud computing models. 
A real-life computational challenge will be given and students will create (during the course) a Cloud-based computing model to solve this challenge. 
Access to a limited set of Cloud resources and services will be granted to students in order to complete the exercises.  
Containers and in particular Docker Containers will be introduced as for the concept of High Performance Computing (HPC). 
Notions about the emerging “Fog” and “Edge” computing paradigms and how they are linked to Cloud infrastructures will conclude the course.
