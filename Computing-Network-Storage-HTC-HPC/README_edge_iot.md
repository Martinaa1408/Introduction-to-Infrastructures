# README: IoT, Edge, Fog Computing and Digital Twins

## Overview

This module focuses on modern distributed systems that extend beyond centralized cloud infrastructures. Concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge and Fog computing, and Digital Twins are explored in relation to real-time computing, latency, bandwidth, and data analytics.

## 1. Internet of Things (IoT)

**IoT** is a network of interconnected physical devices that collect and exchange data via the Internet.

### Key Characteristics:

* **Sensors & Actuators**: Embedded in devices to sense and act on environments.
* **Connectivity**: Via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LPWAN, etc.
* **Data Streams**: Constant generation of telemetry data.

> Examples: Smart thermostats, wearables, connected vehicles.

### Challenges:

* Network congestion
* Real-time processing
* Scalability and security

## 2. Edge and Fog Computing

Both paradigms aim to bring computation closer to the data source, reducing latency and easing bandwidth loads.

### Edge Computing

* Processing occurs **directly on or near the IoT device**.
* Minimizes round-trip to data centers.
* Ideal for real-time applications (e.g., autonomous cars).

### Fog Computing

* Acts as an intermediary layer between Edge devices and Cloud.
* Aggregates, filters, and processes data before sending it upstream.
* Often deployed on local gateways or routers.

| Feature      | Edge Computing                 | Fog Computing                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Location     | On-device or near-device       | Gateway / local network node |
| Latency      | Very low                       | Low                          |
| Compute Load | Light-weight                   | Moderate                     |
| Use Case     | Sensor filtering, ML inference | Aggregation, pre-processing  |

## 3. Digital Twins

A **Digital Twin** is a virtual representation of a physical system or device, often updated in real-time through IoT data.

### Characteristics:

* Mirrors behavior, status, and structure of the real-world object.
* Enables prediction, optimization, and diagnostics.
* Often implemented in smart factories, supply chains, and energy systems.

### Workflow:

1. Physical object has sensors.
2. Data is streamed to the digital replica.
3. Simulation and analytics are performed.
4. Real-time feedback is applied.

> Strongly linked with Edge and IoT devices for continuous monitoring.

## 4. Real-Time Processing

* **Latency-sensitive** applications demand low delay.
* **Bandwidth management** is crucial for constrained networks.

| Technology | Latency  | Typical Use                     |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Cloud      | High     | Archive, backup, heavy compute  |
| Fog        | Low      | Filtering, real-time dashboards |
| Edge       | Very low | ML inference, safety systems    |

> Trade-off between local compute cost and central availability.

## 5. Connections to Other Domains

**Cloud**: Edge and Fog reduce load and latency in cloud systems.
**Machine Learning**: Deployed at the edge for fast inference.
**Containers**: Lightweight execution at edge nodes using Docker/uDocker.
**Big Data**: IoT contributes high-volume and high-velocity data streams.
**Security**: Critical in distributed, often physically unprotected IoT networks.

## Summary

IoT, Edge, and Fog computing provide decentralized, responsive, and scalable infrastructure for modern applications. Digital Twins enable real-time simulation and optimization, while edge processing ensures speed and bandwidth efficiency. These technologies bridge physical and virtual domains and complement cloud and HPC architectures.
